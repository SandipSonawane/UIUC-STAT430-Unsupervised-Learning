    "\n",
    "In previous analyses we used several different clustering algorithms to cluster our shill bidding dataset. In this analysis we will use k-means to cluster the shill bidding dataset into the four underyling cluster (as suggested by the t-SNE algorithm). We will then use PCA four times on the data in each of the four clusters to learn more about what makes the data in each of the four clusters distinct. Specifically, we would like to learn more about the *linear relationship between the attributes* along the vector that describes the most amount of variance for each of the four clusters.\n",
