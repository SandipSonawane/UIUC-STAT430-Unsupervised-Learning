    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will continue our exploration of the same random sample of the \"Fashion MNIST\" dataset. *As a reminder, this dataset is comprised of 500 28-by-28 pixel images of fashion items. Each of the 784 image pixels is represented by a numerical gray scale value which can range from 0 (black) to 255 (white). Each object has an associated pre-assigned class label, which corresponds to the fashion item that the image is a picture of. The 10 types of fashion items included in this dataset are: Pullover, Sandal, Bag, Ankle boot, Coat, Shirt, T-shirt/top, Sneaker, Dress, and Trousers.*\n",
